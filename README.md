It's a Basic Design to represent how a Bank works and what are the different operations and constraints of an Account. 
We used C/C++ Programming Languages to code this project presentation. The internal Structure of this program will be implemented with the help of a new concept called Linked List of Objects, this will permit us to create and handle new accounts dynamically.

While moving toward the implementation of this project, we will keep updating the internal structure of it and give comments on our weekly evolution....
