This is an Academic Project on a personal simulation about Bank Management System (in abbrev. BMS).
It's a Basic Design to represent how a Bank works and what are the different constraints while creating a Client's Account.
I used C/C++ Programming Languages to code this project presentation. The internal Structure of this program is more of a Structured Oriented and it's based on linked list concept. In the coming months, I will release an Object Oriented Program of this project to the Open Source Community, where many concept will be review according to the needs and new variants of clients.
